If you're setting up a Windows PC, for some reason, then;

1: first follow https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/pain/-/blob/master/w10-painkiller.txt - 

2: and then install all you can from https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/1992869 -

3: and then go line-by-line through https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/personal-autosetup-linux-ubuntu/-/blob/master/personal-autosetup-linux-ubuntu-script-run.sh inheriting all you can do on Windows,

and then you should be relatively setup.
