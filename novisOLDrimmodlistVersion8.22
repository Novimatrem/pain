novi's OLDrim modlist Version 8.22
Requires all DLC, SKSE, and RaceMenu

A reminder that SkyUI started causing your game to crash constantly.
Do not install it, delete it if it is present, do not subscribe to it on the Workshop.
Also, Auto FOV started causing the FOV to go very very fucky, so the same to that.
As well, Quick Loot caused saving to become disabled, so the same to that.
Similarly, moreHUD caused fast travel to crash the game, so not that, either.
